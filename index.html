            Hi! My name is <strong class="name">Karthik Venkatesh Nagaraj</strong>, and I am currently a 4th year Computer Science student at Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland. I am Indian by nationality, but was born in the United Arab Emirates in 2002. I moved to Dublin in 2020 to pursue my degree in Computer Science.

            During my time so far at Trinity, my appreciation for the different niches in Computer Science has grown exponentially. As part of certain modules, I have been privlieged to work along with large companies like Propylon and Qualcomm, where I learned a lot about different fields of Computer Science like Software Engineering, Graphics, and Game Development. Apart from this, I  have managed to garner a lot of interest in the field of Cyber Security.
